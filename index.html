                    Hi. I  am Rishabh and this is me ‚Äî> üòÑ. This site will give you a quick overview about me. The page will only talk about my personal life. My professional page is under construction. So, I am 23 years old when I am creating this site and this is my first hands-on experience on front-end (so please be kind to my design üòä). I don't think I'm a very good writer because I haven‚Äôt tried before. I was thinking about what could be the topic for my first writing and after brainstorming for about 2 minutes,  I said to myself, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs start with me!!‚Äù xD.

                    I am part of a family of 4 that consists of my parents, my lovely brother and me. My brother is 14 years younger than me and is the dearest to my heart and I think he is the smartest kid I know! (He asks questions which I mostly have to google. :-!) My father is the owner of a jewelry shop and my mother is a homemaker who cooks the most delicious food in the entire world. My family has been and will continue to be, one of my constant inspirations that makes me want to work harder in my life so I can provide them with everything that I can.

                        I can never forget my experience of college. I got into an electrical and electronics programme in BITS-Pilani, Hyderabad Campus which had the best rule - no compulsory attendance; the rule which I (and all of the students) misused the most üòõ. Watching movies or TV series till late night and sometimes till morning and then not attending classes was the common routine. My sleep and meal schedule was badly impacted by this to a point it started causing problems for me to focus on studies. I soon realised I needed to fix this up when my grades started getting impacted by this. So I did. As the saying goes, you only learn by making mistakes. Such kind of experiences really made me responsible and value my time more.

                    <p>
                        Other than that I got the opportunity in some leadership roles such as the president of the regional association of North India and during my time as the president, my college peeps celebrated the festival of Lohri with great pomp and show. Apart from learning from my personal experiences, I learnt a lot from my friends who have been a constant in my college life.

                    In our college, we were compelled to live in the college hostels only, which was the beginning of many new friendships for me. When you spend so much time with someone, the closeness develops naturally. But the closeness I experienced with my college friends, who happened to be my wing(a corridor) mates too, was so immense that we would literally do everything together. We would be  teaching each other before the exams, playing games, celebrating festivals, enjoying our college fests, dancing on the DJ nights, watching movies, touring the city of Hyderabad and later on going for trips to Goa and Pondicherry. But even with so many memories, the most memorable time for me would be our ‚ÄúPEACE SESSIONS‚Äù where we would all gather and simply talk about any stresses we had been facing in our lives and try to support each other. It was like a free therapy session for most of us and really helped me be more compassionate and understanding with people in my life. Here is a pic of my friends. From left to right(standing): Nikhil, Me, Sachet, Vishal, Prajjval, Anirudh, Anhsuman; (sitting): Shikhar, Mayank, Shubham, Mayank.

                        I like to think of myself as being more intellectually inclined but here are few of my hobbies I have discovered over time.

                        During my sophomore year, I got obsessed with billiards. I wasn't that good when I started playing but later on I was representing our college in that game during our annual sports festival. My hero was Ronnie ‚ÄòO Sullivan who is a great combination of a physicist and an artist in a snooker player.

                        Right from the beginning of my college life, I was highly focussed on my fitness and thereby I used to run A LOT. I did gymming too but running was my passion and was a great stress buster. Now, whenever I don‚Äôt get a chance to go to the gym, I try to workout at home and do push-ups, squats, pull-ups and running of course, to stay fit.

                        Though I am not a very good reader, I am pushing myself to be one. I like to read in my free time, during office breaks, metro rides, flights, or while just laying on bed before I sleep. I have so far covered The Kite Runner, 1st and 2nd parts of The Shiva Trilogy, Rich Dad Poor Dad, The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari, Who Will Cry When You Die?

                        Next, I should talk about something which is very close to my heart and that is Dance. Frankly speaking, the sounds of any beat can get me started. I am not a trained dancer but I surely have some moves üôÇ.

                        In my free time, I listen to Porcupine Tree for peace and play sudoku to just drill my brain and let it not get rusty.

                    As I was approaching my graduation, I sensed the financial liability lynching on my family, an invisible pressure whose burden cracked up all the savings and arose the feeling of helplessness. Thankfully, I got a job in a big company with a handsome salary but I wanted to make sure, from the beginning, that I won‚Äôt end up wasting or in better terms would invest my time and money well. I have learnt the importance of investment the hard way and many don‚Äôt get it till the end. We relate financial independence to earn a good amount of money but actually it should be how to handle the money in our pockets. That‚Äôs what financial education is which we don‚Äôt get to learn anywhere when it should be taught in the schools. I want to impart that education to as many people as possible in my life.
